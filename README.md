# work-scheduler

The goal of this project was to create a program that would allow a user to enter different tasks for certain time blocks, allowing them to plan their days down to the hour and into the future. This project utilized three languages: HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also availed myself of many supplemental resources on StackOverflow, W3 Schools and the stalwart YouTube.
